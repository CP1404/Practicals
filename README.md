# Practical Solutions for IT@JCU CP1404/CP1804/CP5632

Selected practical solutions are provided here, in this "solutions" branch.  
These are to help you learn by evaluating your own work and seeing our suggested ways of solving the practical problems. 

## Important 

Please use the solutions in a mature and honest way, as helpful learning tools... _after_ you complete your own work, _not_ as something to simply copy into your own prac work. OK?
