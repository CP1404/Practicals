# Practical 09 - Inheritance

Don't forget to make a new branch (starting from an up-to-date `master`), `prac_09_feedback` _before_ you start!

In this practical, you will work on extending classes with inheritance.  
There's a lot of _teaching_ in this prac, so make sure you read carefully and do a lot of _learning!_

# Inheritance

We recently started making our own classes and objects:

- A **class** is a blueprint (the code) for creating an **object**
  (an object is also known as an **instance**).
- A class is a new **type**.
- **Objects** store data in instance variables (`self.something`) and provide access to the **methods** (functions)
  defined in the class.

Inheritance is (only) appropriate where you are building a more specialised version of a class. Inheritance can be
described as an "is a" relationship.  
When class Y inherits from class X, it should always be the case that an
**is a** relationship holds: Y "is a" X.

For example, a Tree is a Plant, but it's not true to say a Cat is a Dog. So, it is appropriate for a `Tree` class to
inherit from a `Plant`
class, but not appropriate for a `Cat` class to inherit from a `Dog`
class.  
Both Cat and Dog could inherit from `Animal`.

# Walkthrough Example

In a previous practical, we looked at a `Car` class. This time we will see that we can extend the Car class to make
a `Taxi` class, which is a more specialised version of a Car.  
**Taxi is a Car**  
In Java, you would write the code: `Taxi extends Car`.

You can use your car from last week, or the finished version in the solutions. Either way, copy your `car.py` file to
your `prac_09` folder.

Download [taxi.py](taxi.py)

Read the code and see that the `Taxi` class *extends* the `Car`
class in two ways:

- it adds new attributes (`price_per_km`,
  `current_fare_distance`) and methods (`get_fare`,
  `start_fare`)
- it *overrides* methods (`drive`, `__init__` and
  `__str__`) to take account of the characteristics of a Taxi.

Notice that the `drive` method still works the same way in terms of its ***interface*** - it takes in a distance
parameter, and it returns the distance driven.  
This is important for *polymorphism* - so that we can treat all subclasses
of **Car** in the same way - we `drive()` a taxi the same way we `drive()` any other car.

## Test Taxi

File: `taxi_test.py`

Create a separate file to try out your first taxi.  
We don't usually write client code in class files, but rather we use separate files.

Write lines of code for each of the following (**hint**: use the methods available in the Taxi class):

1. Create a new taxi object, `my_taxi`, with name "Prius 1", 100 units of fuel and price of $1.23

2. Drive the taxi 40 km

3. Print the taxi's details and the current fare

4. Restart the meter (start a new fare) and then drive the car 100 km

5. Print the details and the current fare

## Class Variables

_Are you reading carefully and learning? Don't skim this!_

Depending on what kind of system you're modelling with `Taxi`, it might make sense that all taxis have the same price
per km.  
We don't want to get into one taxi and pay $2.20, then find another one was only $1.20.  
So, we can use a **class variable**, which is a variable that is ***shared*** between all instances of that class.  
You define class
variables directly _after_ the class header line and _before_ any method definitions.

1. Add the **class variable** `price_per_km` to the Taxi class (in
   `taxi.py`) and set it to `1.23`
2. Change the **`__init__`** function so that it does *not* take in the price_per_km, which means it doesn't need to set
   `self.price_per_km` because that's already set by the class variable.

   ```python
   class Taxi(Car):
       """Specialised version of a Car that includes fare costs."""
       price_per_km = 1.23
   
       def __init__(self, name, fuel):
           ...
   ```
3. Change any client code (where you create your `Taxi` objects)
   so that you don't pass in this value.

4. Test your code and see if you get the same output (you should).

When using class variables, you can either:

- refer to the variable as `Taxi.price_per_km`, which explicitly refers to the class variable shared by any Taxi
  instances, or
- use `self.price_per_km`, which refers to the instance variable that may or may not exist... Python looks for an
  instance variable in the object and if it doesn't find it there, then it looks up to the class variable, then it
  looks up to the parent class...  
  *This is usually preferred*, because it allows you to update the value for each object if needed (as we will see
  later with the `SilverServiceTaxi`).

# Intermediate Exercises

## UnreliableCar

File: `unreliable_car.py` and `unreliable_car_test.py`

Let's make our own derived class for an `UnreliableCar` that inherits from `Car`.

`UnreliableCar` has an additional attribute:

- `reliability`: a `float` between 0 and 100, that represents the percentage chance that the `drive` method will
  actually drive the car

`UnreliableCar` should override the following methods:

- `__init__(self, name, fuel, reliability)`
    - call the `Car`'s version of `__init__`, and then set the `reliability` to the value passed in

- `drive(self, distance)`
    - generate a random number between 0 and 100, and only drive the car if that number is less than the car's
      reliability.  
      Don't store the random number! It's not a self/instance variable that you want to remember, it's a temporary value that
      you generate and use once, every time you call `drive()`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `drive` method in the base class
> `Car` ***always*** returns the distance driven, so your derived class
> `UnreliableCar` must also return a distance.  
> This is true, even if your `UnreliableCar` drives 0 km.
> You must match the "signature" of any method you override.  

### Test

In `unreliable_car_test.py` write tests that demonstrate the functionality of the class work. You do not need to test base class methods, only those specific to this class.  
Since the functionality involves randomness, we can't reliably ensure that our test passes with just one method call, can we?  
If we have a 30% reliable car, and we attempt to drive it, should it drive or not? It might... or it might not. So, consider using a loop to test many iterations of driving. If you drive it 100 times and the 30% reliable car drives 100 times, or 1 time, is it working? Probably not.  

## SilverServiceTaxi

File: `silver_service_taxi.py` and `silver_service_taxi_test.py`

Now create a new class for a `SilverServiceTaxi` that inherits from
`Taxi`. Do you see the pattern for naming class files?

So `SilverServiceTaxi` *is a* `Taxi` and `Taxi` *is a* `Car`
(which also means `SilverServiceTaxi` is a `Car`)

This allows you to have a different effective `price_per_km`, based on the fanciness of the `SilverServiceTaxi`.

1. Add a new *attribute*, `fanciness`, which is a `float` that scales (multiplies) the `price_per_km`. Pass
   the `fanciness` value into the constructor and multiply
   `self.price_per_km` by it.  
   Note that here we can get the initial base price using
   `Taxi.price_per_km`, then customise our object's instance variable,
   `self.price_per_km`. So, if the class variable (for all taxis) goes up, the price change is ***inherited*** by all
   `SilverServiceTaxi`s.  
   If you're not sure about this, please ask! Don't go on without "getting it".

2. `SilverServiceTaxi` also has an extra charge for each new fare, so add a `flagfall` *class variable* set to `4.50`.

3. Add or override whatever method you need to (think about it...) in order to calculate the fare.

4. Write a `__str__` method so that you can add the `flagfall`
   to the end. E.g., for a Hummer with a fanciness of 4, it should display like:

       Hummer, fuel=200, odo=0, 0km on current fare, $4.92/km plus flagfall of $4.50

   Note that you can reuse the parent class's `__str__` method like:
   `super().__str__()`

5. Write some test code in a file called `silver_service_taxi_test.py` to see that your
   `SilverServiceTaxi` calculates fares correctly.  
   Use `assert` tests to ensure that your code does what it is supposed to.  
   For an 18 km trip in a `SilverServiceTaxi` with fanciness of 2, the fare should be $48.78 (yikes!)

## Pause and reflect

Let's stop and think about what we've done and (hopefully) learned so far:

- We can create new classes by *extending* existing ones - e.g., `Taxi` extends `Car`.

- Derived (child) classes inherit all the attributes and behaviours of their base (parent) classes - e.g., we do not
  need
  to write a new
  `add_fuel()` method for `Taxi` because it comes from `Car` already, and we don't need anything different in a taxi.

- We can *override* (customise) derived classes by modifying existing methods so that they do different (but usually
  similar)
  things.  
  We should always make sure that the signature of overridden methods matches the base class - e.g., the `drive()`
  method in `Taxi` also calculates a fare, and in `UnreliableCar` it may or may not drive any distance... but in ***
  all***
  cases, the method takes in a distance value and returns the distance driven.

Here is what the **class hierarchy** looks like now for `Car` and its related classes (remember you can "read" these
arrows like "Taxi *is a* Car"):

![Car class hierarchy diagram](../images/09image1.png)

## Inheriting Enhancements

One more thing before we move on...  
_Are you still reading and learning carefully?_

It is important to see how using inheritance actually benefits the systems we model with classes.  
Currently, all Taxis (including SilverServiceTaxis and any other derived classes we might make) calculate the fare
as `price_per_km * current_fare_distance`, and you can get results like $48.78 in the example above...

What if we decided that all taxis should have final fares that are rounded to the nearest 10c, so that $48.78 would
change to $48.80?  
Well, we should only need to make this change to the base `Taxi` class, and it will be inherited by
`SilverServiceTaxi`... *but only if* we have called **`super().get_fare()`** and not rewritten the calculation in our
new
classes.  
That is, we should only need to change one place because we should have practised the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY)
principle.  
If we didn't call the `super` method, but just repeated the calculation, then changing the base class will *not* change
the derived class!  
Make sense? Let's do it.

- First, run your silver_service_taxi_test program from above and make sure your output produces something that's not
  already a multiple of 10c (such as the example above that produces $48.78).

- Now update the `get_fare()` method in `Taxi` and make it use the
  `round()` function to return a value rounded to 10c.

- Re-run your test, and you should get a result rounded to 10c (e.g., $48.80). If it worked, you should see that we only
  changed `Taxi` and that enhancement was inherited by `SilverServiceTaxi`. Nice :)

### Yet Another Important Note About Functions

`get_fare()` must return a *number*, not a *string*!  
Even though we may want to format the result like currency (e.g. `"$48.80"`), that's not this function's single
responsibility. What if we wanted to add fares together? They must be numbers. Do your string formatting *outside* this
function.

## Association, not inheritance

Before we do our final exercise(s) using inheritance, let's build something using **association**, which is not
inheritance, but sometimes mistaken for it.

There are two kinds of association.  
Both are **"has a"** relationships.

- **Aggregation** - e.g., "Musician has a Guitar". Objects can be "inside" another, but it's possible for them to exist
  without the object they aggregate under. They have their own life cycles. A guitar can exist without the musician.
- **Composition** - e.g., "Person has a Heart". This is a strong type of aggregation. The objects "inside" do not have
  their own life cycle. A heart cannot exist without its person.

In the same way that a `Car` has a `name` or a `Project` has a `start_date`, any object can have an attribute that's an
instance of another class.

Let's see how a `Musician` "has a" `Guitar`.  
**Download**:

- [guitar.py](guitar.py)
- [musician.py](musician.py)
- [my_band.py](my_band.py)

We've seen `Guitar` before, but now we have a `Musician` class and a musician "has" a list of instruments, which could
be `Guitar` objects.

Have a look at the testing code at the bottom of `Musician` and note some things:

- the `import` is NOT at the top like usual. The reason we don't import the `Guitar` class at the top, is because we
  only need it when we run the testing code.
- `assert` is used to ensure that a default-value `Musician` is setup correctly.
- We add `Guitar` objects to the `Musician` object's list of instruments. This is the "Musician has Guitar" association
  relationship.

### Band

Now, write the missing `Band` class that `my_band.py` uses.

"Band has Musicians" in much the same way that "Musician has Guitars" (association).  
Here's what you should see when your `Band` class is correct:

    band (str)
    Extreme (Nuno Bettencourt ([Washburn N4 (1990) : $2,499.95, Takamine acoustic (1986) : $1,200.00]), Gary Cherone ([]), Pat Badger ([Mouradian CS-74 Bass (2009) : $1,500.00]), Kevin Figueiredo ([]))
    band.play()
    Nuno Bettencourt is playing: Washburn N4 (1990) : $2,499.95
    Gary Cherone needs an instrument!
    Pat Badger is playing: Mouradian CS-74 Bass (2009) : $1,500.00
    Kevin Figueiredo needs an instrument!

There are plenty of fun extension exercises in this prac, including one to use inheritance with this example by creating
different "types" of `Musician`, like "Guitarist is a Musician" and "Drummer is a Musician" (well, a drummer hangs
around with musicians).

# Do-from-scratch Exercises

File: `taxi_simulator.py`

Write a taxi simulator program that uses your `Taxi` and
`SilverServiceTaxi` classes.

Each time, until they quit:

- The user should be able to choose from a *list* of available taxis,
- They can choose how far they want to drive,
- At the end of each trip, show them the trip cost and add it to their bill.

Use a list of taxi objects, which you create in main and pass to functions that need it.  
When you choose the taxi
object, your code will call the `drive()` method on that object, and it will use the right method for that class... so
from the client code point of view, driving a taxi will work the same whether the object is a `Taxi` or a
`SilverServiceTaxi`, but the results (including the price) depend on the class.  
This is ***polymorphism***.

In this program, there's the chance the user will  
drive a taxi before choosing one. This shouldn't crash.  
A good option is to maintain something like a `current_taxi`... but what will the initial value of this variable be?  
When you want a default starting value for an object, don't use a string or other unrelated type...  
Instead, you use `None`:

    current_taxi = None

The taxis used in the example below would be like:

    taxis = [Taxi("Prius", 100), SilverServiceTaxi("Limo", 100, 2), SilverServiceTaxi("Hummer", 200, 4)]

# Practice & Extension Work

## Cars

Create more kinds of cars that make sense to you and test them, e.g. select from:

a.  `GasGussler` - uses more fuel than it should

b.  `Bomb` - doesn't actually move when you drive it, but still uses the fuel

c.  `EcoTaxi` - uses half the fuel and gives a percentage discount on the price per fare

d.  [CrazyTaxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Taxi)

## Musicians

Create different "types" (subclasses) of `Musician`, like:

- `Guitarist`
- `Drummer`
- `Singer`

For each one, consider **overriding** their `play` method to do something relevant to their role. E.g., a singer won't "
need an instrument" but might be like, "Gary Cherone is singing".  
You don't need to override the `play` method if the one in `Musician` is already satisfactory for the role.

Then, copy your `my_band.py` program to create a new version that creates the band Extreme with more specific roles.  
E.g., instead of:

    kevin = Musician("Kevin Figueiredo")

You'll write:

    kevin = Drummer("Kevin Figueiredo")

Once you've done that. Make the program as interesting as you can.

## Trees

The focus of this exercise is on inheritance - looking for what methods need to be changed (overridden) in the derived
classes. Don't get hung up on the details of the methods...

Trees: some grow wide, some grow thin; some grow fast, some grow slow.

**Open these two files:** [trees.py](trees.py) and [trees_tester.py](trees_tester.py)

trees.py contains the `Tree` class. A `Tree` object has a
`trunk_height`, and a `number_of_leaves`.  
The ``__str__`` method of `Tree` returns a string representation of the `Tree`. For example, if `trunk_height`
is 2, and `number_of_leaves` is 8, the tree would look like

    ##
    ###
    ###
     |
     |

The size of a `Tree` can be changed by calling the `grow` method, which takes in `sunlight` and `water` and
randomly increases the
`trunk_height` and `number_of_leaves`.

Not all trees look the same or grow the same, however, so we're going to build specialised classes to represent
different types of trees. To achieve this, we're going to use inheritance.

There are already two completed subclasses of `Tree` in `trees.py`:

### `EvenTree`

Even trees only grow leaves in multiples of three.  
That way the leaves always appear in clean rows.

### `UpsideDownTree`

Upside-down trees are drawn upside-down.

`trees_tester.py` grows **seven** types of trees. Try running it now. The final four types of trees are subclasses
of `Tree` for you to complete:

### `WideTree`

a. Wide trees grow their leaves in rows of six, and have a trunk that is twice as wide as normal trees

b. You will need to redefine the `get_ascii_trunk` and
`get_ascii_leaves` methods

c. Example drawing:

     ####
     ######
     ######
       ||
       ||

### `QuickTree`

a. Quick trees grow much quicker than normal trees - their leaves always increase by however much sunlight falls on
them, and their trunks always grow by however much water they receive.

b. You will need to redefine the `grow` method.

c. Quick trees look exactly the same as normal trees, they just grow differently.

### `FruitTree`

a. Fruit trees have a number of `fruit`

b. Add a `fruit` variable to the `FruitTree` class; initialise it as 1

c. Fruit trees sometimes gain an additional fruit when the `grow`
method is called, the chance is 1 in 2

d. Fruit trees sometimes lose a fruit when the `grow` method is called, the chance is 1 in 5

e. Example drawing (fruit are represented by a dot `.`)    
the fruit should be displayed the same way as the leaves, wrapping within the maximum width

    ..
    ###
    ###
     |
     |
     |

### `PineTree (challenge)`

a. pine trees look like

       *
      ***
     *****
    *******
       |
       |    

b. pine trees start off with four leaves (1 + 3)

c. pine trees only ever add as many leaves as would make a full new row at the bottom of the tree

i. i.e. they must form a triangle shape

ii. row 1 always has 1 leaf, then 3 for row 2, 5 for row 3, 7 for row 4, 9 for row 5 and so on

iii. every time the `grow` method is called, the pine tree should add a new row of leaves if a random number between
0 and sunlight is bigger than 2

## Taxi Simulator Enhancements

Enhance your taxi driving program so that it:

- doesn't let you drive until you've chosen a taxi
- has error-checking for choosing a valid taxi
- keeps track of the number of km you've done (actual distance driven not total requested)
- displays the taxis with their costs (`flagfall` and `fanciness`)
