# CP1404/CP5632 Practicals

This repository contains instructions and code for practicals for the subjects CP1404/CP5632 at James Cook
University.  
Instructions are found in each prac folder.  
Some code files contain `# TODO` comments, which are part of the instructions for what students need to do.

## Marking

**As of 2026, practical work is not assessed.**

> [!NOTE]
> This subject is all about learning best-practices and clean coding using
> the [patterns taught](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns).
> It is important that you learn these important foundations according to the teaching of the subject.    
> Please do your practical work in such a way that you learn well. Don't bother using GenAI, searching for solutions, etc. or otherwise trying to skip the requirements. Do what helps you learn.  

## Solutions

Selected practical solutions are provided here, in the **"solutions"** branch.  
These are to help you learn from evaluating your own work and seeing our suggested ways of solving the practical
problems.

Not all solutions are provided.  
Not all provided solutions are complete.
E.g., a question may require extra functionality, but its solution may only have the base code.  
This is on purpose.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please use the solutions in a mature and honest way, as helpful learning tools...  
> _after_ you complete your own work, _not_ as something to simply copy into your own prac work. OK?  
> Seriously, **never copy the solutions** as this will not help you learn as much as doing your own work.
