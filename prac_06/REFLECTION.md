# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I've started recording time it takes for me to start and finish.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I have the bad habit of being completely distracted, such as cooking, playing games, etc while coding since it's a way for me to relief stress. 

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I've gotten a lot more focused and I've kept up with the accessments instead of fixing 

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to give myself time to breathe with Pseudocode because I am very impatient and I like to get started instantly. This also causes problems later on while coding because I tend to have the plans in my head, which I'm too lazy to write down. This also result in some parts of the code being rewritten or discarded entirely when I write it again on a different time or day.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I don't have any suggestion.
