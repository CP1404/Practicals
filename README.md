# CP1404/CP5632 Practicals

This repository contains instructions and code for practicals for the subjects CP1404/CP5632 at James Cook
University.  
Instructions are found in each prac folder.  
Some code files contain `# TODO` comments, which are part of the instructions for what students need to do.

## Practical Content

* [Practical 01 - PyCharm, Control](./prac_01)

* [Practical 03 - Files, Exceptions](./prac_03)
* [Practical 04 - Lists](./prac_04)
* [Practical 05 - Dictionaries, Code Reviews with PRs](./prac_05)

* [Practical 07 - Classes 2](./prac_07)
* [Practical 08 - Kivy](./prac_08)
* [Practical 09 - Inheritance](./prac_09)
* [Practical 10 - Testing, APIs, Flask](./prac_10)

and if you're really keen, here's another practical that we used to have in the subject, focused on using the `os`
(operating system) module:

* [Practical - OS](./prac_os)

## Marking

Assessment will be based on completing the tasks up to but not including
the practice/extension section. You will be marked according to the rubric, which is usually follows:

- 100 = Excellent response to all requirements (Always aim for this!)
- 75 = Good response to most or all requirements, but some omissions or problems
- 50 = Reasonable response to some requirements, but some significant omissions or problems
- 25 = Reasonable response to at least one requirement
- 0 = Minimal or no attempt
- LATE practicals will receive no more than 50/100 for decent work, or down to 0 marks for poor work.  
  **Do not be late**.

For practicals that require a code review, the prac work will be worth 80% and the code review worth 20%.  
Code reviews will be marked as follows:

- 100 = Good code review with well-written, thoughtful comments
- 50 = Adequate code review
- 0 = No code review, or no URL submitted

> [!NOTE]
> This subject is all about learning best-practices and clean coding using
> the [patterns taught](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns).
> It is important that you learn these important foundations according to the teaching of the subject.    
> So, to help your learning, prac work must be done in the way that we prescribe to achieve full marks.

> [!CAUTION]
> Here are some reasons that you might lose marks for your practicals and assignments:
> - Your work looks too similar to any provided solutions, code found online or answers made by services like ChatGPT
> - You miss or skip part of a question (you must attempt all requirements)
> - Your work includes concepts and code not taught in the subject
> - Your work does not follow the core concepts and patterns taught (e.g., using global variables, while True loops or
    similar techniques), even if they work!

## Submission

Each prac includes a "Deliverables" section that tells you what to submit.

- Submit your files **and** any requested GitHub URLs. _(No GitHub in prac 1.)_
- Most pracs require you to submit one or more GitHub URLs.  
  Please type the URL(s) of your **GitHub practicals repository** (pracs 2-4) or PR (pracs 5-10) at the
  top of the text box when you submit your practical on LearnJCU.
- If the prac (5-10) requires a code review pull request (PR):
    - Your PR URLs will look something like: `https://github.com/lindsaymarkward/cp1404practicals/pull/1`
    - Your code review URLs will be very similar but with the other student's repo. The link should take us directly to
      the PR where you have done your code review.
    - [@Mention the appropriate student from the list](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Code-Review-Order) in your PR.
- Do not zip up your files.
- Submit your practical on LearnJCU with each file attached to one submission.
- If you need to resubmit additional attempts, you must include all files in the new submission.
- Ensure each file has the correct name, including the extension. If you don't use the right extensions, we cannot read
  your work in LearnJCU.
- Ensure your code is not commented-out. Only comments should be commented.
- Include a `# comment` for any parts of questions that need separate answers. E.g., if a question has parts `a.`
  and `b.` then add comments like `# a.` and `# b.` to make it clear where your answers are, and to show you what you
  need to complete.
- Rewrite any `# TODO` comments as appropriate.

## Solutions

Selected practical solutions are provided here, in the **"solutions"** branch.  
These are to help you learn from evaluating your own work and seeing our suggested ways of solving the practical
problems.

Not all solutions are provided.  
Not all provided solutions are complete.
E.g., a question may require extra functionality, but its solution may only have the base code.  
This is on purpose.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please use the solutions in a mature and honest way, as helpful learning tools...  
> _after_ you complete your own work, _not_ as something to simply copy into your own prac work. OK?  
> Seriously, **never copy the solutions** as this will not help you learn as much as doing your own work.
